Wicked multi-platform transparent client-side encryption of your files in the cloud.

Download native binaries of Cryptomator on [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/) or clone and build Cryptomator using Maven (instructions below).

## Features

- Works with Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, and any other cloud storage service that synchronizes with a local directory
- Open Source means: No backdoors, control is better than trust
- Client-side: No accounts, no data shared with any online service
- Totally transparent: Just work on the virtual drive as if it were a USB flash drive
- AES encryption with 256-bit key length
- Filenames get encrypted, too
- Use as many vaults in your Dropbox as you want, each having individual passwords

### Privacy

- 256-bit keys (unlimited strength policy bundled with native binaries)
- Scrypt key derivation
- Cryptographically secure random numbers for salts, IVs and the masterkey of course
- Sensitive data is wiped from the heap asap
- Lightweight: [Complexity kills security](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/1999/11/a_plea_for_simplicit.html)

### Consistency

- HMAC over file contents to recognize changed ciphertext before decryption
- I/O operations are transactional and atomic, if the filesystems support it
- Each file contains all information needed for decryption (except for the key of course), no common metadata means no [SPOF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)

### Security Architecture

For more information on the security details visit [cryptomator.org](https://cryptomator.org/architecture/).

## Building

### Dependencies

* Java 8 + JCE unlimited strength policy files (needed for 256-bit keys)
* Maven 3
* Optional: OS-dependent build tools for native packaging (see [Windows](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-win), [OS X](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-osx), [Linux](https://github.com/cryptomator/builder-containers))

### Run Maven

```
cd main
mvn clean install
```
